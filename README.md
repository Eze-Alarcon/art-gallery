## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - all-in-one web framework.

### What I learned

The main purpose of this idea was to learn how "astro" worked, this framework that was becoming popular and is really practical when developing static pages with very little configuration but still with a great variety of implementations.

### Continued development

Although I learned how astro worked, I think I did not get the full potential of astro due to the simplicity of the project, however, what I learned will be very useful to implement it in other projects.
